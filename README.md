Nexudus Spaces - GULP + SASS + ES6 Theme
============================

Originally forked from: [Nexudus Starter](https://github.com/Nexudus/nexudus-spaces-default-theme)

#### Purpose

To add modern practices to the Nexudus starter theme.

- [x] Add in SASS compiling
- [x] Add in Webpack and Javascript compiling and allow modular ES6 Support
- [ ] Remove Bootstrap
- [ ] Add custom grid system
- [ ] Add default styling that doesn't relie on Bootstrap (near? bourbon? custom?)
- [ ] Attempt to remove jQuery dependencies (seems nexudus relies heavily on fullcalendar so might not be possible)
- [ ] Move all inline/external CSS into the build process
- [ ] Move as much of the external Javascript into the build process via NPM
